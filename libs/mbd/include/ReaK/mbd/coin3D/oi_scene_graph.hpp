/**
 * \file oi_scene_graph.hpp
 *
 * This library declares a class that can act as an intermediate between a collection of
 * geometric entities from ReaK and an OpenInventor scene-graph (via Coin3D). First, this
 * class acts somewhat like a standard iostream (with << operators) to sequentially add anchors,
 * geometries, complete models, or KTE chains to the current scene-graph stored within an object
 * of this class. Second, this class has internal mechanisms to update all the anchors (coordinate
 * frames, or transformations) relating to the geometries such that the scene-graph is in-sync
 * with those anchors. This mechanism is enabled and disabled with the enableAnchorUpdates()
 * and disableAnchorUpdates() functions, respectively.
 *
 * For the most part, this class acts as a single dependency point between ReaK objects and
 * Open-Inventor. Under-the-hood, this class checks the dynamic types of the objects it is
 * given and constructs the appropriate Open-Inventor sub-graph for each type it can recognize
 * and support. This is not pretty, but it is the lesser evil between that and the alternative,
 * which is to give each relevant objects in ReaK a virtual method (from a common base-class)
 * which can create the Open-Inventor sub-graph for itself, which would effectively couple
 * the entire ReaK library to Open-Inventor (or require some awkward dummy linking scheme).
