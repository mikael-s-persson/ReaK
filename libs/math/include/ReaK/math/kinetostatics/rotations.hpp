/**
 * \file rotations.hpp
 *
 * This library declares all geometric rotation classes for fixed (2,3) and variable dimensions.
 *
 * Note: All matrix memory is organized, by default, such that columns are concatenated. This
 *       was found to be a more efficient representation since columns often have
 *       more significances than rows (representing basis vectors for example).
