 *
 * This library defines the traits and concepts related to an interpolator and interpolator factories. An
 * interpolator is simply an object that stores some representation of a trajectory
 * segment between two points. The basic scheme used in ReaK is to have one interpolator factory object
 * that serves to generate fresh interpolators for a given trajectory segment. In other words,
 * from a user's perspective, the factory can be used to store certain data that all interpolators will
 * need (e.g. information about motion limits or general parameters of the interpolation scheme). The
 * intended use from within the library is to store one interpolator factory object (set by the user)
 * and use that factory object to create interpolators for each segment of a trajectory.

 *the end-point at its associated time while respecting the limits.
