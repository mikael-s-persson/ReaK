 * This concept represents a predicted trajectory, as used in ReaK::pp. This concept
 * supplements the SpatialTrajectoryConcept with a few additional requirements which
 * characterize a predicted trajectory (see PredictedTrajectoryConcept).
 *
 * Required concepts:
 *
 * The PredictedTrajectory should model the SpatialTrajectoryConcept on the given Topology.
 *
 * The Topology should model the TemporalSpaceConcept.
 *
 * Valid expressions:
 *
 * std::pair< const_waypoint_descriptor, point_type> w_p;  A waypoint is a pair of a const-waypoint descriptor and a
 *point on the topology.
 *
 * p.set_initial_point(pt);  The initial temporal point (pt) can be set to seed the predicted trajectory (p).
 *
 * p.set_initial_point(w_p);  The initial temporal waypoint (w_p) can be set to seed the predicted trajectory (p).
 *
 * \tparam PredictedTrajectory The trajectory type to be checked for compliance to this concept.
 * \tparam Topology The temporal-topology type that can contain the trajectory.
