 * Required concepts:

 * The topology should model the MetricSpaceConcept.
 *
 * The distance-metric should model the DistanceMetricConcept.
 *
 * Valid expressions:
 *
 * std::pair< const_waypoint_descriptor, point_type > w_p;  A waypoint-point pair is used to associate a point and a
 *waypoint.
 *
 * pt = p.move_away_from(pt, d);  A point along the path (p), at a distance (d) from a point (pt), can be obtained.
 *
 * d = p.travel_distance(pt,pt);  The travel distance, along the path (p), between two points (pt,pt), can be obtained.
 *
 * w_p = p.move_away_from(w_p, d);  A waypoint along the path (p), at a distance (d) from a waypoint (w_p), can be
 *obtained.
 *
 * d = p.travel_distance(w_p,w_p);  The travel distance, along the path (p), between two waypoints (w_p,w_p), can be
 *obtained.
 *
 * pt = p.get_start_point();  The starting point of the path can be obtained.
 *
 * w_p = p.get_start_waypoint();  The starting waypoint-pair of the path can be obtained.
 *
 * pt = p.get_end_point();  The end point of the path can be obtained.
 *
 * w_p = p.get_end_waypoint();  The end waypoint-pair of the path can be obtained.
 *
 * \tparam SpatialPath The type to be checked for the requirements of this concept.
 * \tparam Topology The topology in which the spatial-path should reside.
