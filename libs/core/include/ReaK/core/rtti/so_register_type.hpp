  /*
   * Explanation of registration scheme:
   * The register_type template is instantiated for every class that has a RK_RTTI_REGISTER
   * MACRO in its declaration. That MACRO inserts an invocation of the "impl" static member
   * within a virtual function (the getObjectType() function), which has the effect of forcing
   * this static member to be considered as "used somewhere", which means the compiler must
   * generate its static initialization code, i.e., the constructor of register_type_impl
   * must get executed before entering main, and in that constructor, the type is registered
   * to the global repository of types. This sequence is the key to making this work because
   * the presence of "impl" invocation somewhere within the body of a virtual function makes it
   * so that even when the class being registered is a template, it must be created, because
   * only virtual functions are guaranteed to be instantiated (even if never used) in a class
   * template instantiation.
   *
   * The use of get_ptr() is there to avoid a static initialization order fiasco between a class
   * and its base-classes, which might not have been initialized yet.
