 *
 * This library contains the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree generation algorithm with an
 * A* rewiring policy.
 * This is a method to create a random tree that will span over a non-convex space
 * as rapidly as possible. The method relies on a simple randomized insertion algorithm.
 * At each step, a random point is picked from the underlying topology (i.e. configuration
 * space in path-planning terms). Then, the points in the current graph that are nearest
 * to the random point are picked for expansion. Then, edges (of a maximum length) are
 * added to the nearest vertex towards the random point while it is still possible to
 * add such an edge without leaving the free space (the part of the configuration space which
 * is not occupied by an obstacle). Finally, the last point of the expansion is used to attempt
 * the same expansion with the other nearest neighbors and the accumulated cost-to-go of all
 * these alternate paths are compared and the edge that leads to the shortest accumulated cost-to-go
 * is selected as a new edge in the tree. The algorithm will stop when either the number of vertices
 * in the tree has reached a maximum or when the user callback signals the stop.
 *
 * This library also provides the bidirectional version of the RRT* algorithm. In this version,
 * two trees are generated. Typically, one tree is initialized with the starting vertex and
 * the other is initialized with the goal vertex. The algorithm works to try and join the
 * two graphs as quickly as possible and with the most direct path. The algorithm alternates
 * between the two graphs. It first uses the normal procedure (as in the unidirectional variant)
 * to try and add a vertex to one graph. If it does not succeed (i.e. there was no free-space in
 * the expanded direction), it will try to expand the other graph. If it does succeed,
 * than the last vertex that was added to the tree will be the point towards which the other tree
 * will be expanded (if free-space permits). In other words, any successful vertex addition to one
 * tree causes the other to attempt an expansion in that direction, and any failure at adding a vertex
 * to one tree causes the other to attempt to expand towards a random point. This version of the
 * algorithm will also notify the user (via a visitor's callback) whenever one tree was successfully
 * expanded towards the other tree to the point that they meet at two vertices (one on each graph).
 * The user can thus record successful connections as paths and decide whether it's worth continuing
 * with the generation the Bi-RRT in the hopes of finding a better path with richer trees.
