 *
 * This library provides functors to wrap K-NN search functors with a certain strategy to set the
 * number of neighbors and the search radius. In particular, the star_neighborhood functor can be used
 * to form probabilistically optimal algorithms like PRM*, RRG, and RRT*. The single_neighbor functor
 * can be used to wrap a general K-NN search functor into a single nearest-neighbor search.
