/**

 *
 * This library defines a class to solve path planning problems using the
 * Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm (or one of its variants).
 * Given a C_free (configuration space restricted to non-colliding points) and a
 * result reporting policy, this class will probabilistically construct a motion-graph
 * that will connect a starting point and a goal point with a path through C-free
 * that is as close as possible to the optimal path in terms of distance.
