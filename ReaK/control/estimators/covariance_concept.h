/**

 *
 * This library provides a number of concepts and traits related to covariance matrix
 * representations. A covariance matrix type is an abstract type that can provide a
 * covariance matrix to described the uncertainty related to the components of a continuous
 * vector. Since a covariance matrix can be represented in different ways, e.g., as a
 * covariance matrix, as an information matrix, or decomposed, the algorithms in ReaK::ctrl
 * will not assume one representation, but rather relies on the concepts provided in this
 * library to deal with covariance matrices.
