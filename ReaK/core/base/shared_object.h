 * This library declares the basic class "ReaK::shared_object" which allows all descendants
 * to be safely shared across executable modules (given the binary compatibility of the boost
 * smart pointers is kept, this is out of my control). All classes in the ReaK platform
 * should at least be a descendant of this class (except some low-level classes, but no end-user
 * defined classes). Usually, however, end-users will prefer the ReaK::named_object class which
 * adds a name to the objects (and it is the next descendant after ReaK::shared_object).
