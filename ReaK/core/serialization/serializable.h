 * (map and vector) and any other object of the ReaK platform or std::shared_ptr to them are
 * in principle serializable as well, requiring very little effort by the programmer of a
 * new class to implement the save() and load() methods (simply stacking the data members
 * onto the input/output archive is all that is required really, see classes in the control
