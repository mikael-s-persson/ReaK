/**
 * \file extrapolator_concept.h
 *
 * This library defines the traits and concepts related to an extrapolator and extrapolator
 * factories. An extrapolator is simply an object that can generate a trajectory
 * segment from a starting point. The basic scheme used in ReaK is to have one extrapolator
 * factory object that serves to generate fresh extrapolators for a given trajectory segment.
 * In other words, from a user's perspective, the factory can be used to store certain data
 * that all extrapolators will need (e.g. starting point or general parameters of the extrapolation
 * scheme). The intended use from within the library is to store one extrapolator factory
 * object (set by the user) and use that factory object to create extrapolators for each
 * segment of a trajectory.
