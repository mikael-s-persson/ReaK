 * This concept represents a predicted trajectory, as used in ReaK::pp. This concept
 * supplements the SpatialTrajectory with a few additional requirements which
 * characterize a predicted trajectory (see PredictedTrajectory).
 *
 * Required concepts:
 *
 * The Trajectory should model the SpatialTrajectory on the given Topology.
 *
 * The Space should model the TemporalSpace.
 *
 * Valid expressions:
 *
 * std::pair< const_waypoint_descriptor, point_type> w_p;  A waypoint is a pair of a const-waypoint descriptor and a
 *point on the topology.
 *
 * p.set_initial_point(pt);  The initial temporal point (pt) can be set to seed the predicted trajectory (p).
 *
 * p.set_initial_point(w_p);  The initial temporal waypoint (w_p) can be set to seed the predicted trajectory (p).
