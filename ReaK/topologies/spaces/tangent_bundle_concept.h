/**
 * This concept defines the requirements to fulfill in order to model a differential relation
 * as used in ReaK::pp. A differentiable relation serves to map a spatial topology
 * its derivative topology with respect to a given independent space (e.g. time). The mapping
 * also serves to map elements between to two spaces (tangent lifts and descents).
 *
 * Required concepts:
 *
 * All topologies involved should model the TopologyConcept.
 *
 * Valid expressions:
 *
 * space = get_space<0..N>(diff_space,t_space);  The metric space (space) corresponding to the 0 to Nth order derivative
 *space can be obtained given an independent space (e.g. time topology, t_space).
 *
 * v = lift_to_space<1..N>(dp,dt,diff_space,t_space);  A derivative-point (v) can be obtained from lifting a
 *point-difference (dp) from the space via a difference-point on the independent space (dt). This expression is
 *analogous to v = dp / dt.
 *
 * dp = descend_to_space<0..N-1>(v,dt,diff_space,t_space);  A point-difference (dp) can be obtained from descending a
 *derivative-point (v) to the space via a difference-point on the independent space (dt). This expression is analogous
 *to dp = v * dt.
 *
 * \tparam Space The topology type to be checked for this concept.
 * \tparam Order The maximum order of differentiation of the tangent bundle type.
 * \tparam IndependentSpace The topology type to be checked for this concept.
