/**
 * \file reversible_space_concept.h
 *
 * This library defines the traits and concepts that pertain to what can be considered
 * a reversible-space, as used in ReaK::pp. Reversible-spaces are based on the Topology concept
 * from the Boost.Graph library, but with additional requirements which are needed
 * in algorithms tailored for path-planning (mostly). Basically, the concept of a
 * reversible-space corresponds to spaces in which motions can
 * be done in reverse, whether steerable or not.

/**
 * This concept defines the requirements to fulfill in order to model a reversible-space
 * as used in ReaK::pp. A reversible-space is a special kind of topology in which
 * motions can be done in reverse, whether steerable or not.
 *
 * Valid expressions:
 *
 * if(is_metric_space<ReversibleSpace>)
 *   p2 = space.move_position_back_to(p1, d, p3);  A point (p2) can be obtained by moving a fraction (d) back from a
 *final point (p3) to previous point (p1).
 *
 * if(is_steerable_space<ReversibleSpace>)
 *   tie(p2, st_rec) = space.steer_position_back_to(p1, d, p3);  A point (p2) and a steer-record (st_rec) can be
 *obtained from attempting to steer a fraction (d) back from a final point (p3) to previous point (p1).
 *
 * \tparam ReversibleSpace The topology type to be checked for this concept.
